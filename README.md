Parameter estimation from MESA simulations
==================================================

This respository contains supplementary material to the paper:

Millholland, S., Petigura, K., \& Batygin, K. 2020, ApJ, submitted <i> Tidal Inflation Reconciles Low-Density Sub-Saturns with Core Accretion. </i> 

The The IPython notebook entitled "Parameter_estimation_from_MESA_sims_demo.ipynb" contains all analyses involving the Hadden \& Lithwick (2017) dataset of TTV mass estimates. It includes the calculations presented in Section 2 of 
the paper and additional supplementary plots. Note that there is no random number seed, so figures may look slightly different than those presented in the paper. The code relies on the data file named 
"sim_set_MESA_results.txt".  <br />
