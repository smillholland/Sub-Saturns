Planet parameter estimation using MESA simulations
===============================================================

This respository contains supplementary material to the paper Millholland, S., Petigura, K., \& Batygin, K. 2020, ApJ, submitted, <i> Tidal Inflation Reconciles Low-Density Sub-Saturns with Core Accretion. </i> (It is also relevant to the methods of the paper Millholland, S. 2019, ApJ, 886, 72, <i> Tidally Induced Radius Inflation of Sub-Neptunes. </i>)

The IPython notebook entitled "Parameter_estimation_from_MESA_sims_demo.ipynb" contains a demonstration of how to estimate the envelope fraction of an observed planet (in this case, K2-19 b) using a set of previously-generated MESA simulations. The condensed simulation results are provided in the data file named "sim_set_MESA_results.txt", and the contents are outlined in the IPython notebook. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the planet parameters, according to two cases: with and without accounting for tidal heating.
