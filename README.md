Parameter estimation of observed planets using MESA simulations
===============================================================

This respository contains supplementary material to the paper Millholland, S., Petigura, K., \& Batygin, K. 2020, ApJ, submitted <i> Tidal Inflation Reconciles Low-Density Sub-Saturns with Core Accretion. </i> (It is also relevant to the methods of the paper Millholland, S. 2019, ApJ, 886, 72 <i> Tidally Induced Radius Inflation of Sub-Neptunes. </i>)

The IPython notebook entitled "Parameter_estimation_from_MESA_sims_demo.ipynb" contains a demonstration of how to constrain the envelope fraction of an observed planet (in this case, K2-19 b) using a set of previously-generated MESA simulations. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the planetary parameters, and we present two cases with and without accounting for tidal heating. 

The code relies on the data file named "sim_set_MESA_results.txt", which contains results of the MESA simulations described in Section 2.2 of Millholland et al. (2020). The contents of the file are described in the IPython notebook.  <br />
